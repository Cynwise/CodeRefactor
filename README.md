# Code Refactor

## Website Story

  I was given a task to refactor a website for a marketing company in order to add additional accessibility options for screen-reading software. This was assigned to me as an introductory task. 

  I've consolidated the CSS file as it contained unnessary bits of code that were repeated elsewhere. I fixed a bugged link in the page. I implimented symantic html elements, changed the heading tags into a sequental order ,and alt attributes to images on the page to give more functionality for screen-reading software.

  Completeing this assignments taught me a lot about the world of accessibility standards and how screen-readers parse the information laid out in HTML and CSS.
